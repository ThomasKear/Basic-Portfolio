				<p>Spent my younger years on Long Island, New York.  Then my parents retired to the mountains of Hendersonville, NC.  At first, I hated the region and couldn't wait to get out.  Ran away twice, but mountains don't have road signs and just got lost twice.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Right after high school, joined the Marines, loved it at first, but soon relized it wasn't a long term relationship.  Bartended all over DC and had a great time.  Alas my liver told me, that too was not to be a long term relationship.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Fast forward upteen years and then I had my daughter, Beverly Ann.  She made everything make sense.  This, this is my long term relationship, everything else is just a means to an end.  The only thing I can do to be the best father I know, is to always keep improving myself.</p>
